Caesar Cipher Tool

This Python script implements a Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. It includes additional functionalities to enhance the user experience and improve message security.

Features:

Encryption and decryption of messages using a Caesar Cipher with a shift value.
Input validation for both message and shift value.
Message analysis to help identify potential errors (e.g., presence of special characters).
Hidden message input for improved security (uses getpass).
How to Use:

Save the script as caesar_cipher.py.
Run the script from the command line using python caesar_cipher.py.
Follow the prompts to choose an action (e for encryption, d for decryption, or q to quit).
If encrypting or decrypting, enter the message and shift value as prompted.
Example Usage:

Do you want to encrypt or decrypt a message? Input 'e' for encryption, 'd' for decryption, or 'q' to quit: e
Enter the message (invisible, type carefully): This is a secret message.
Enter the shift value (invisible, type carefully): 3

Encrypted Message: Wkh lv d uhvhg rq wkh lqvwuxfwlrq.
Further Development:

You can extend this tool to handle different Caesar Cipher variations (e.g., handling punctuation, multiple alphabets).
Implement error handling for invalid user input.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

Note:

This is a basic implementation of a Caesar Cipher and may not be secure for real-world cryptography.
